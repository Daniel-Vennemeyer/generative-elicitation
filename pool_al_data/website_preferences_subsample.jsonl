Elin Nordegren emerged for the first time since giving birth to her third child. The model, 39, and boyfriend Jordan Cameron cheered on her 10-year-old son, Charlie, at a soccer tournament in Florida on Friday, October 18. The couple brought along their newborn for the family outing. Nordegren glowed in a black, floral-print maxi dress and white sandals. She chatted with Cameron, 31, as he held their first child together. The proud mom took in the game from a chair on the sidelines.

A source told Us in June that she and Cameron were \"very happy about the pregnancy\" and preferred to stay out of the spotlight. \"Elin maintains a low profile and has a normal, boring life,\" the insider revealed. \"Florida allows her to live that quiet life.
